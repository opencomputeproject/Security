# Summary

Throughout this document, the term “Processor” refers to all Central Processing Unit (CPU), System On Chip (SOC), Micro Control Unit (MCU), and Microprocessor architectures.  The document details the required challenge protocol required for Active Component and Platform RoTs.  The Processor must implement all required features to establish a hardware based Root of Trust.  Processors that intrinsically fail to meet these requirements must implement the flash protection Cerberus RoT described Physical Flash Protection Requirements document.

Active Components are add-in cards and peripherals that contain Processors, Microcontrollers or devices that run soft-logic.  

This document describes the protocol used for attestation measurements of firmware for the Platform’s Active RoT.   The specification encompasses the pre-boot, boot and runtime challenge and verification of platform firmware integrity.  The hierarchical architecture extends beyond the typically UEFI measurements, to include integrity measurements of all Active Component firmware.    The document describes the APIs needed to support the attestation challenge for Project Cerberus.



1. Physical Communication Channel

The typically cloud server motherboard layout has I2C buses routed to all Active Components.  These I2C buses are typically used by the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) for the thermal monitoring of Active Components.  In the Cerberus board layout, the I2C lanes are first used by the platform Cerberus microcontroller during boot and pre-boot, then later mux switched back to the BMC for thermal management.  Cerberus can at any time request for the BMC to yield control for runtime challenge and attestation.   Cerberus controls the I2C mux position, and coordinates access during runtime.  It is also possible for Cerberus to proxy commands through the BMC at runtime, with the option for link encryption and asymmetric key exchange, making the BMC blind to the communications.   The Cerberus microcontroller on the motherboard is referred to as the Platform Active Root-of-Trust (PA-RoT).   This microcontroller is head of the hierarchical root-of-trust platform design and contains an attestable hash of all platform firmware kept in the Platform Firmware Manifest (PFM) and Component Firmware Manifest (CFM).

Most cloud server motherboards route I2C to Active Components for thermal monitoring, the addition of the mux logic is the only modification to the motherboard.  An alternative to adding the additional mux, is to tunnel a secure challenge channel through the BMC over I2C.   Once the BMC has been loaded and attested by Cerberus, it can act as an I2C proxy.  This approach is less desirable, as it limits platform attestation should the BMC ever fail attestation.   In either approach, physical connectors to Active Component interfaces do not need to change as they already have I2C.

Active Components with the intrinsic security attributes described in the “Processor Secure Boot Requirements” document do not need to place the physical Cerberus microcontroller between their Processor and Flash.   Active Components that do not meet the requirements described in the “Processor Secure Boot Requirements” document are required to implement the Cerberus micro-controller between their Processor and Flash to establish the needed Root-of-Trust.  Figure 1 Motherboard I2C lane diagram, represents the pre-boot and post-boot measurement challenge channels between the motherboard PA-RoT and Active Component RoTs (AC-RoT).

![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


The Project Cerberus firmware attestation is a hierarchical architecture.  Most Active Components in the modern server boot to an operational level before the platform’s host processors complete their initialization and become capable of challenging the devices.  In the Cerberus design, the platform is held in pre-power-on or reset state, whereby Active Components are quarantined and challenged for their firmware measurements.   Active Components must respond to challenges from the PA-RoT confirming the integrity of their firmware before they are taken out of quarantine.

In this version of the Cerberus platform design, the PFM and CFMs are static.  The manifest is programmable through the PA-RoT’s communication interface.   Auto-detection of Active Components and computation of the PFM/CFM will be considered in future version of the specification.   The PFM and CFM are manifests of allowed firmware versions and their corresponding firmware measurements.   The manifests contain a monotonic identifier used to restrict rollbacks. 

The PA-RoT uses the measurements in the CFM to challenge the Active Components and compare their measurements.  The PA-RoT then uses the digest of these measurements as the platform level measurement, creating a hierarchical platform level digest that can attest the integrity of the platform and active component firmware.

The PA-RoT will support Authentication, Integrity and Confidentiality of messages.  Active Components RoT’s (AC-RoT) will support Authentication and Integrity of messages and challenges.  To facilitate this, AC-RoT are required to support certificate authentication.  The Active Component will support a component unique CA signed challenge certificate for authentication. 

Note:  I2C is a low speed link, there is a performance tradeoff between optimizing the protocol messages and strong cryptographic hashing algorithms that carry higher bit counts.   RoT’s that cannot support certificate authentication are required to support hashing algorithms and either RSA or ECDSA signatures of firmware measurements.



    1. 
Power Control
In the Cerberus motherboard design, power and reset sequencing is orchestrated by the PA-RoT.   When voltage is applied to the motherboard, it passes through in-rush circuity to a CPLD that performs time sensitive sequencing of power rails to ensure stabilization.  Once a power good level is established, the platform is considered powered on.  Upon initial powering of the platform in the Cerberus design, the only active component powered-on is the PA- RoT.   The RoT first securely loads and decompresses its internal firmware, then verifies the integrity of Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware by measuring the BMC flash.  When the BMC firmware has been authenticated, the Active RoT enables power to be applied to the BMC.  Once the BMC has been powered, the Active RoT authenticates the firmware for the platform UEFI, during which time the RoT sequences power to the PCIe slots and begins Active Component RoT challenge.   When the UEFI has been authenticated, the platform is held in system reset and the Active RoT will keep the system in reset until AC-RoTs have responded to the measurement challenge.  Any PCIe ports that do not respond to their measurement challenge will be subsequently unpowered.   Should any of the expected Active Components fail to respond to the measurement challenge, Cerberus policies determine whether the system should boot with the Active Component powered off, or the platform should remain on standby power, while reporting the measurement failure to the Data Center Management Software through the OOB path.



2. Communication 

The Cerberus PA-RoT communicates with the AC-RoT’s over I2C.  The protocol supports an authentication and measurement challenge.  The Cerberus PA-RoT generates a secure asymmetric key pair unique to the microcontroller closely following the DICE architecture.  Private keys are inaccessible outside of the secure region of the Cerberus RoT.   Key generation and chaining follows the RIoT specification, described in section: 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates. Derived platform alias public keys are available for use in attestation and communication from the AC-RoT’s during the challenge handshake for establishing communication.   



    1. RSA/ECDSA Key Generation

The Cerberus platform Active RoT should support the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE) architecture.  In DICE, the Compound Device Identifier (CDI) is used as the foundation for device identity and attestation.  Keys derived from the Unique Device Secret (UDS) and measurement of first mutable code are used for data protection within the microcontroller and attestation of upper firmware layers.  The Device Id asymmetric key pair is derived cryptographically from the CDI and associated with the Device Id Certificate.  The CDI uses the UDS derived from PUF and other random entropy including the microcontroller unique id and Firmware Security Descriptors.  

Cerberus implements the RIoT Core architecture for certificate generation and attestation.   For details on key generation on DICE and RIoT, review section:  9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates.

Note:  The CDI is a compound key based on the UDS, Microcontroller Security Descriptors and second stage bootloader (mutable) measurement.   The second stage bootloader is mutable code, but not typically updated with firmware updates.   Changes to the second stage bootloader will result in a different CDI, resulting in different asymmetric Device Id key generation. Certificates associated with the previous Device key will be invalidated and a new Certificate would need to be signed.  

A second asymmetric key pair certificate is created in the RIoT Core layer of Cerberus and passed to the Cerberus Application firmware.    This key pair forms the Alias Certificate and is derived from the CDI, Cerberus Firmware Security Descriptor and measurement of the next stage Cerberus Firmware.  

Proof-of-knowledge of the CDI derived private key known as the Device Id private key is used as a building-block in a cryptographic protocol to identify the device.    The Device Id private key is used to sign the Alias Certificate, thus verifying the integrity of the key.   During initial provisioning, the Device Id Certificate is CA signed by the Microsoft Certificate Authority.  When provisioned, the Device Id keys must match the previously signed public key.

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


Note:  The CDI and Device Id private key are security erased before exiting RIoT Core.

Each layer of the software can use its private key certificate to sign and issue a new certificate for the next layer, each successive layer continues this chain.   The certificate in the application layer (Alias Certificate) can be used when authenticating with devices and establishing a secure channel.  The certificate can also establish authenticity.  Non-application layer private keys used to sign certificates must be accessible only to the layer they are generated.  The Public keys are persisted or passed to upper layers, and eventually exchanged with upstream and downstream entities.



    2. Chained Measurements

The Cerberus firmware measurements are based on the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE) architecture: [https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures) 

The first mutable code on the RoT is the Second Bootloader (SBL).   The CDI is a measurement of the HMAC(Device Secret Key + Entropy, H(SBL)).   This measurement then passes to the second stage boot loader, that calculates the digest of the Third Bootloader (TBL).  On the Cerberus RoT this is the Application Firmware:  HMAC(CDI, H(TBL)).  


    Figure 4 Measurement Calculation


    

<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png).

![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


The Third Stage Bootloader (TBL) which runs the Cerberus Application Firmware will take additional area measurements of the SPI/QSPI flash for the Processor it protects, measuring both active and inactive areas.   The TBL measurements are verified and extended with an attestation freshness seed. The final measurement is signed, sealed, and made available to the challenge software.

Seeds for attesting firmware by the application firmware can be extended from Cerberus Firmware measurements, or using the Alias Certificates a dedicated freshness seed can be provided for measuring the protected processor firmware.

The measurements are stored in either firmware or hardware register values within the PA-RoT.   The seed is typically transferred to the device using the Device Cert, Alias Cert or Attestation Cert.





3. Protocol and Hierarchy

The following section describes the capabilities and required protocol and Application Programming Interface (API) of the motherboard’s Platform Active RoT (PA-RoT) and Active Component to establish a platform level RoT.  The Cerberus Active RoT and Active Component RoTs are required to support the following I2C protocol.   

The protocol is derived from the MCTP SMBus/I2C Transport Binding Specification.  A limited version of the protocol is defined for devices that do not support MCTP.   If an AC-RoT implements the Attestation Protocol over MCTP, it may also optionally implement the minimum attestation protocol over native SMBus/I2C.



    3. Attestation Message Interface

The Attestation Message Interface uses the MCTP over I2C message protocol for transporting the Attestation payloads.   The AC-RoT MCTP Management Endpoint should implement the required behaviors detailed in the Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) Base Specification, in relation to the MCTP SMBus/I2C Transport Binding Specification.   The following section outlines additional requirements upon the expected behavior of the Management Endpoint:



*   The Message Interface Request and Response Messages are transported with a custom message type.  
*   MCTP messages will be transmitted in a synchronous Request and Response manner only.   An Endpoint (AC-RoT) should never initiate a Request Message to the Controller (PA-RoT).  
*   MCTP Endpoints must strictly adhere to the response timeout defined in this specification.   When an Endpoint receives a standard message, it should be transmitting the response within 100ms.  If the Endpoint has not begun transmitting the Response Message within 100ms, it should drop the message and not respond.
*   MCTP Endpoints must strictly adhere to the response timeout advertised for cryptographic commands.  Cryptographic commands include transmission of messages signature generation and verification.   The cryptographic command timeout multiplier is negotiated in the Device Capabilities command.
*   MCTP leaves Authentication to the application implementation.  This specification partially follows the flow of USB Authentication Specification flow, when authentication has been established attestation seeds can be exchanged.
*   It is not required that the Management Endpoint response to ARP messages.  AC-RoT Endpoints should not generate any ARP messages to Notify Master.  Devices should be aware they are normally behind I2C muxes and should not master the I2C bus outside of the allotted time they are provided to response to an MCTP Request Message.   
*   MCTP Endpoint devices should be response only.
*   Irrespective as to whether Endpoints are ARP capable, they should operate in a Non-ARP-capable manner.  
*   MCTP specifications use big endian byte ordering while this specification uses little endian byte ordering.  This ordering does not change the payload order in which bytes are sent out on the physical layer.
*   Endpoints should support Fixed Addresses; Endpoint IDs are supported to permit multiple MCTP Endpoints behind a single physical address.
*   As defined in the MCTP SMBus/I2C Transport Binding Specification Endpoints should support fast-mode 400KHz.   
*   Endpoint devices that do not support multi-master should operate in slave mode.  The PA-RoT PCD will identify the mode of the device.   The Master will issue SMBUS Write Block in MCTP payload format, the master will then issue an I2C Read for the response.   The Master read the initial 12 bytes and use byte 3 and the MCTP EOM header bits to determine if additional SMBUS read commands are required to collect the remainder of the response message.
*   Endpoints should support EID assignment using the MCTP Set Endpoint ID control message.
*   Endpoints should support the MCTP Get Vendor Defined Message Support control message to indicate support level for the Cerberus protocol.

The Platform Cerberus Active RoT is always the MCTP master.  Active Component RoT’s can be configured as Endpoint, or Endpoint and Master.   An Active Component RoT Endpoint and Master should interface to separate physical busses.   There is no requirement for master arbitration as master and slave definitions are hierarchically established.  The only hierarchy whereby the Active Component RoT becomes both Endpoint and Master is when there is a downstream sub-device, such as the Host Bus Adapter (HBA) depicted in the following block diagram:


    Figure 6 Root of Trust Hierarchy


    

<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png).

![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


In this diagram, the HBA RoT is an Endpoint to the Platform Active RoT and Master to the downstream HBA Expanders.  To the Platform’s Active RoT, the HBA is an Endpoint RoT.   To the HBA Expanders, the HBA Controller is a Master RoT.

The messaging protocol encompasses Management Component Transport Protocol (MCPT) Base Specification, in relation to the MCTP SMBus/I2C Transport Binding Specification, whereby the Active Component RoT is Endpoint and the Platform’s Active RoT as Master.   



    4. Protocol Format

All MCTP transactions are based on the SMBus Block Write bus protocol.  The following diagram shows MCTP encapsulated message.


    Figure 7 MCTP Encapsulated Message


    

<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png).

![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


A package should contain a minimum of 1 byte of payload, with the maximum not to exceed the negotiated MCTP Transmission Unit Size.  The byte count indicates the number of subsequent bytes in the transaction, excluding the PEC.

The PEC at the end of each transaction is calculated using a standard CRC-8, which uses polynomial x<sup>8</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1, initial value of 0, and final XOR of 0.  This CRC is independent of the message integrity check defined by the MCTP protocol.  The CRC is calculated over the entire encapsulated MCTP packet, which includes all headers and the destination I2C address as it was sent over the I2C bus (bytes 1 through N in Figure 7 MCTP Encapsulated Message).  Since the I2C slave address is not typically included as part of the transaction data, the CRC is equal to CRC8 (7-bit address &lt;< 1 || I2C payload).  For example, an MCTP packet sent to a device with 7-bit I2C address 0x41 would have a CRC calculated as CRC8 (0x82 || packet).



    5. Packet Format

The Physical Medium-Specific Header and Physical Medium-Specific Trailer are defined by the MCTP \
transport binding specification utilized by the port. Refer to the MCTP transport binding specifications.

A compliant Management Endpoint shall implement all MCTP required features defined in the MCTP base specification.

The base protocol’s common fields include message type field that identifies the higher layer class of message being carried within the MCTP protocol.

Null (0) Source and Destination EIDs are typically supported, however AC-RoT devices that have multiple MCTP Endpoints may specify an EID value greater than 7 and less than 255.  The PA-RoT does not broadcast any MCTP messages.



    7. MCTP Messages

An MCTP message consists of one or more MCTP packets.  There are typically two types of Messages, MCTP Control Messages and MCTP Cerberus Messages.  Control Messages are standard MCTP messages with a maximum message body of 64 bytes.  Cerberus Messages are those defined in this specification.  The maximum message body for these messages is 4096 bytes, but this size can be negotiated to be smaller based on device capabilities.

MCTP Control Messages do not contain the per-packet CRC described in section 3.2.



        1. Message Type

The message type should be 0x7E as per the Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) Base Specification.   The message type is used to support Vendor Defined Messages where the Vendor is identified by the PCI based Vendor ID.  The initial message header is specified in the Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) Base Specification, and detailed below for completeness:

The Vendor ID is a 16-bit Unsigned Integer, described in the PCI 2.3 specification.  The value identifies the device manufacturer.

The message body and content are described in Table 4 MCTP Message Format.



        2. Message Fields

The format of the MCTP message consists of a message header in the first two bytes, followed by the message data, and ending with the Message Integrity Check.

The Message header contains a Message Type (MT) field and Integrity Check (IC) that are defined by the MCTP Base Specification.  The Message Type field indicate 



        3. Message Integrity Check

The Message Integrity Check field contains a 32-bit CRC computed over the contents of the message



        4. Packet Assembly into Messages

An MCTP message may be split into multiple MCTP Packet Payloads and sent as a series of packets. Refer to the MCTP Base Specification for packetization and message assembly rules.



        5. Request Messages

Request Messages are messages that are generated by a Master MTCP Controller and sent to an MCTP Endpoint.  Request Messages specify an action to be performed by the Endpoint. Request Messages are either Control Messages or Cerberus Messages. 



        6. Response Messages

Response Messages are messages that are generated when an MCTP Endpoint completes processing of a previously issued Request Message.  The Response Message must be completed within the allocated time or discarded.



    8. EID Assignment

The BMC will assign EIDs to the different Active Component RoT devices. All Active Component RoT devices should support the MCTP Set Endpoint ID control request and response messages. The Platform Active RoT will have a static EID of 0x0B.



4. Certificates

The PA-RoT and AC-Rot will have a minimum of two certificates: Device Id Certificate (typically CA signed by offline CA) and the Alias Certificate (signed by the Device Id Certificate).   The PA-RoT may also have an additional Attestation Certificate signed by the Device Id Certificate.

Certificates follow the 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates.



    9. Format

All Certificates shall use the X509v3 ASN.1 structure.  All Certificates shall use binary DER encoding for ASN.1.  All Certificates shall be compliant with RFC5280.  To facilitate certificate chain authentication, Authority and Subject Key Identifier extensions must be present.  Further certificate requirements are defined in the 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates.  Extensions beyond those required by RFC5280 or DICE are allowed so long as they conform to the appropriate standards.  Custom extensions must be marked non-critical.



        7. Textual Format

All text ASN.1 objects contained within Certificates, shall be specified as either a UTF8String, PrintableString, or IA5String. The length of any textual object shall not exceed 64 bytes excluding the DER type and DER length encoding.



        8. Distinguished Name

The distinguished name consists of many attributes that uniquely identify the device.  Distinguished name uniqueness can be accomplished by including attributes such as the serial number.



        9. Object Identifier

Object Identifier should follow 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates



        10. Serial Number

As per 9.3 DICE and RIoT Keys and Certificates, the Certificate _Serial Numbers_ MUST be statistically unique per-Alias Certificate. 

If the security processor has an entropy source, an 8-octet random number MAY be used. 

If the security processor has does not have an entropy source, then an 8-octet _Serial Number_ MAY be generated using a cryptographically secure key derivation function based on a secret key, such as those described in SP800-108 [9.6 NIST Special Publication 800-108].  The _Serial Number_ MUST be unique for each generated certificate.  For the Alias Certificate, this SHOULD be achieved by incorporating the FWID into the key derivation process (e.g. as the _Context_ value in SP-800-108)

If the 8-octet serial number generated is not a positive number, it may be padded with an additional octet to maintain compliance with RFC5280.



    10. Certificate Chain

The maximum Certificate Chain Size is 4096 bytes.  There is no additional encoding necessary for the certificate chain as each certificate can be retrieved individually.

The certificate recommended cryptographic methods for interoperability are defined in Table 3 Recommended Algorithms for Interoperability

5. Authentication

Authentication is the process used to establish trust in a specific device and prove integrity of the device firmware.  Once a device is authenticated, a secure session can optionally be established to provide confidentiality.  For some devices, a secure session can also be used to enable a cryptographic binding that can be used for additional security or to enable additional functionality.  

A device only needs to support a single session from another endpoint.  In single session devices, the establishment of a new session will supersede and terminate the existing session to permit the new session.  The previous session will be terminated upon receiving an out of session (unencrypted) Get Digests request specifying a requested key exchange.  Get Digests requests received in session (encrypted) or without requesting key exchange will not cause the active session to terminate.  



    11. PA-RoT and AC-RoT Authentication

Devices are authenticated using the Alias certificate chain and signed firmware measurements.   The certificate chain is endorsed by the Certificate Authority signing the Device Id Certificate.   The certificate hierarchy is explained in the TCG [Implicit Identity Based Device Attestation](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG-DICE-Arch-Implicit-Identity-Based-Device-Attestation-v1-rev93.pdf) Reference.

The certificate authentication flow closely follows the USB Authentication Architecture and Authentication Messages.  The command structures defined in this specification are derived from the USB-C Authentication Protocol.  Relevant sections of the specification are as follows:

Section 3 Authentication Architecture of USB Authentication Specification

Section 4 Authentication Protocol of USB Authentication Specification

Section 5 Authentication Messages of USB Authentication Specification

The authentication sequence starts with the master (e.g. PA-RoT) issuing a Get Digests command.  The slave (e.g. AC-RoT) responds with a list of SHA256 hashes for each certificate in the device’s Alias certificate chain.  If the master has cached the certificate chain, it may optionally skip requesting these certificates.

If the master does not have the correct certificates, it will issue a Get Certificate request for each certificate in the slave’s Alias certificate chain.  The slave will respond with the requested certificates, which must have origination from a trusted CA.

The master will verify the Alias certificate chain of the slave.  If verification fails or the certificate has been revoked, the authentication will fail.  The PA-RoT and AC-RoT can be updated with revocation patches, see firmware update specification for further details.

Once the certificate chain has been authenticated, the master will verify firmware integrity through the Challenge request.  The slave will generate a Challenge response signed with its Alias key which includes the measurement of device firmware.  The master can verify this measurement against a Component Firmware Manifest (CFM) or some other reference to confirm the firmware is valid.



        11. Authentication Sequence
1. Master issues Get Digests command for Slot 0
2. Slave responds with digests for the Alias certificate chain
3. For each certificate in the chain, Master checks if the certificate has been cached
4. If the certificate has not been cached, Master issues Get Certificate request
5. Slave responds with the request certificate
6. Master verifies the Alias certificate chain against a trusted root CA
7. Master issues Challenge command containing a nonce (RN1)
8. Slave generates a response containing
    *   Random nonce (RN2)
    *   Collective firmware measurement (PMR0)
    *   Signature over request/response pair using the Alias key
9. Master verifies the signature and firmware measurement

    12. Secure Session Establishment

Cerberus devices may optionally support secure session establishment to provide confidentiality between two devices or between external data center software and the device.  Session establishment leverages the basic authentication flow with an additional key exchange to establish the secure session.  Device authentication uses the identity certificate chain, while the session key exchange is based on ephemeral ECDH keys.  The Device Capabilities command will determine if a device supports secure sessions.

After querying the for the device capabilities, the master will begin the authentication sequence by issuing a Get Digests request.  When using authentication to establish a secure session, the Digests request will also indicate the type of key exchange that will be ultimately be used.  If the device does not support the requested key exchange, it will respond with an error.

After authentication has completed, the master will generate an ephemeral key and send it to the slave.  The slave will generate its own ephemeral session key and complete the key exchange.  Session keys will be derived by running ECDH and subsequent KDFs over the session keys and nonces that were included in the challenge.

The KDF used for deriving session and HMAC keys is NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode.  Session state is volatile.  Each end of the session must be able to handle a loss of session context and support session re-establishment.



        12. Session Establishment Sequence

The session establishment flow starts with standard authentication described is Section 5.1.1.  Once the slave has been authenticated, the key exchange is used to establish the session.



1. Master generates an ephemeral ECC key pair and sends a Key Exchange request with Type 0 that includes the public key (PKreq).
2. Slave generates an ephemeral ECC key pair of equivalent strength (PKresp).
3. Slave generates a 256-bit AES session key (K<sub>S</sub>) using NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode
    1. K<sub>I</sub> = ECDH (PKreq, PKresp)
    2. Label = RN1
    3. Context = RN2
    4. r = 32
4. Slave generates a 256-bit MAC key (K<sub>M</sub>) using NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode
    5. K<sub>I</sub> = ECDH (PKreq, PKresp)
    6. Label = RN2
    7. Context = RN1
    8. r = 32
5. Slave sends a Key Exchange response that includes:
    9. The slave session public key (PKresp).
    10. A signature using the Alias key over PKreq and PKresp.
    11. An HMAC of its Alias key certificate using K<sub>M</sub>.
6. Master generates the same session and MAC keys using the public key in the Key Exchange response.
7. Master validates the signature and HMAC on the response.
8. Messages can now be encrypted with 256-bit AES-GCM using the shared session key.

![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")




    13. Secure Device Binding

In some scenarios, it is necessary to have an additional level of authentication between the devices.  This additional authentication mechanism is used to pair two devices such that replacement of either device would be detected.  Detection of unauthorized part replacement is flagged as a security violation.

The binding comes from an additional KDF run on the session key to derive the final session key.  Each device partaking in the tightly coupled pairing contain a common HMAC key that is used in a KDF to device the paired session key.  This common HMAC key is derived from session data available the first time the two devices establish a secure session.



        13. Secure Device Binding Sequence

A paired session with device binding begins with a standard secure session.  Once the session has been established, an additional key exchange is used to update the session key.  This additional key exchange must be encrypted.



1. Master loads the pairing key (K<sub>P</sub>)
    1. If this is the first pairing request, the Master generates the key using NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode
        1. K<sub>I</sub> = K<sub>S</sub>
        2. Label = pairing
        3. No Context
        4. r = 32
    2. If the Master has already been paired to the Slave, the Master loads key from secure storage.
2. Master generates a new session key (K<sub>S’</sub>) using NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode.
    3. K<sub>I</sub> = K<sub>P</sub>
    4. Label = K<sub>S</sub>
    5. No Context
    6. r = 32
3. Master sends a Key Exchange request with Type 1 that includes the length and HMAC of the pairing key using K<sub>M</sub>.  This message is encrypted with the current session key (K<sub>S</sub>).
4. Slave loads K<sub>P</sub>
    7. If this is the first paring request from this Master, the Slave generates the key using the same inputs as the Master.
    8. If the Slave has already paired with the Master, the Slave loads the key from secure storage.
5. Slave calculates the pairing key HMAC and compares it to the received data.
6. If this is the first paring request from this Master, Slave securely stores K<sub>P</sub>.
7. Slave generates a new session key (K<sub>S’</sub>).
8. Slave generates a Key Exchange response encrypted with K<sub>S’</sub>.
9. Master verifies the response using K<sub>S’</sub>.  Failure to decrypt with K<sub>S’</sub> will require the Master to decrypt with K<sub>S</sub> since the Slave will not update the session key on failure.
10. The secure session continues using K<sub>S’</sub>.  Messages encrypted with K<sub>S</sub> will not be processed by either side.

6. Command Format

The following section describes the MCTP message format to support the Authentication and Challenge and Attestation protocol.   The Request/Response message body describes the Vendor Defined MCTP message encapsulated inside the MCTP transport.  This section does not describe the MCTP Transport Header, which includes the MCTP Header Version, Destination Endpoint ID and other fields as defined by MCTP protocol.   The MCTP message encapsulation is described in section 3.2

The MCTP Get Vendor Defined Message Support command enables discovery of what Endpoint vendor defined messages are supported.   The discovery identifies the vendor organization and defined messages types.  The format of this request is described in the MCTP base protocol specification.

For the Cerberus protocol, the following information shall be returned in response to the MCTP Get Vendor Defined Message Support request:



*   Vendor ID Format = 0
*   PCI Vendor ID = 0x1414
*   Command Set Version = 4

The protocol header fields are to be included only in the first packet of a multiple packet MCTP message. After reconstruction of the message body, the protocol header will be used to interpret the message contents.  Reserved fields must be set to 0.



        14. Encrypted Messages

If the crypt field is set in the protocol header, the message body contains encrypted data.  The command code byte and full message payload, reconstructed from individual MCTP packets, is encrypted.  The session establishment flow described in section 5 is used to generate the encryption keys.  An encrypted message will have a 16-byte GCM authentication tag and 12-byte initialization vector in plaintext at the end of the message body.  The following table shows the body of an encrypted Cerberus message, with the encryption trailer.  Segments shaded in grey indicate ciphertext, and white indicate plaintext.

<sup>4</sup> For implementations that use PFM, CFM, or PCD configuration files, Get Config IDs is Required.



    17. Message Body Structures

The following section describes the structures of the MCTP message body. 



    18. Error Message

The error command is returned for command responses when the command was not completed as proposed, it also acts as a generic status for commands without response whereby “No Error” code would indicate success.   The Msg Tag, Seq and Command match the response to the corresponding request.   The Message Body is returned as follows:

    20. Device Capabilities

Device Capabilities provides information on device functionality.  The message and packet maximums are negotiated based on the shared capabilities.  Some additional considerations apply when determining appropriate maximum sizes:



1. Per the MCTP specification, the packet payload size must be no less than 64 bytes.
2. Per section 3.5, the message payload size must be no more than 4096 bytes.
3. The total packet size supported by the device will include the encapsulation defined in section 3.2, excluding the first byte of destination address.  For example, a maximum packet payload of 247 bytes will result in 256 bytes being transmitted for every packet:  1 byte destination address, 3 bytes SMBus header, 4 bytes MCTP header, 247 bytes payload, and 1 byte CRC-8.
4. Some commands do not support being separated across messages.  Devices must support a maximum message size that is compatible with the expected payloads for supported commands.
5. Master devices, such as PA-RoTs, should support the maximum message size of 4096 bytes to ensure full compatibility with any slave device.

    23. Export CSR

Exports the Device Identification Certificate Self Signed Certificate Signing Request.  The initial Certificate is self-signed, until CA signed and imported.   Once the CA signed version of the certificate has been imported to the device, the self-signed certificate is replaced.

    24. Import Certificate

Imports the signed Device Identification certificate chain into the device.  Each import command sends a single certificate in the chain to the device, and there is no requirement on the order in which these certificates must be imported.  Upon verification of a complete chain, the device is sealed, and no further imports can occur without changes to firmware.  A response message is returned before certificate chain validation has been performed with the new certificate and only indicates if the certificate was accepted by the device.  The complete state of certificate provisioning can be queried with the Get Certificate State request.

Upon receiving a certificate, the device will start to authenticate the stored certificate chain.  When sending multiple certificates, it may be necessary to ensure the previous authentication step has completed before sending a new certificate.  The authentication status can be checked with the Get Certificate State command.

    26. GET DIGESTS

This command is derived from the similar USB Type C-Authentication Message.  The Protocol Version byte is not included, the Message Type is present in the Command byte of the MCTP message.  See: Table 4 MCTP Message Format.  The response is different, since certificate handling deviates from USB Type C, and the reserved bytes are repurposed.

This command can be sent at any time.  If authentication was previously established, this command will renegotiate/override the previous authentication and session establishment.  The byte 2, reserved USB Type C – authentication specification, is used to describe the key exchange algorithm.  This is relevant when the requester and responder support multiple key exchange algorithms.

Slots that do not contain a valid certificate chain will generate a response with 0 digests.  Payload byte 2 will indicate that no digests are returned.

    27. GET CERTIFICATE

This command retrieves the public attestation certificate chain for the AC-RoT.  It follows closely the USB Type C Authentication Specification.

The firmware digests are measurements of the security descriptors and the firmware of the target components.  This firmware measurement data does not include Cerberus PCD, CFM or PFM.  These measurements are returned in PMR1.  The numbers are retrieved in the 6.44 Get Configuration Ids.  The USB-C Context Hash is not included in the CHALLENGE.  This is replaced with contextual measurements for the device.   Note: The attestation Certificate derivation will include the measurement of firmware and security descriptors.   PMR0 is anticipated to be the least changing PMR as it contains the measurement of security descriptors and device initial boot loader. 



    29. Key Exchange

Key Exchange is used to establish an encrypted channel with a device.  The session establishment flow is detailed in Section 5 Authentication.

Upon receiving this message with Key Type 0, both sides can establish an encrypted session.   If Key Type 1, the paired key is also compared, and paired functionality is unlocked if verified to match the expected key.   The Key Type 1 can only be performed under an encrypted session, as the session key is required for the HMAC.  When initially calculating a pairing key (K<sub>P</sub>) for device binding, the HMAC specified in the Key Type 0 request for the session will be used with the KDF.

When closing an established session (Key Type 2), the response will be transmitted in plain text if the session was successfully terminated.

Length determined by end of log, or packet size based on device capabilities see section: 6.7 Device Capabilities. If response spans multiple MCTP messages, end of response will be determined by an MCTP message which has a payload less than maximum payload supported by both devices. To guarantee a response will never fall exactly on the max payload boundary, the responder must send back an extra packet with zero payload.



        15. Attestation Log Format

The attestation log will report individual measurements for all components of each PMR.  Each measurement will be a single entry in the log.  The entire log consists of each entry sequentially concatenated.  The structure of the entry closely resembles TCG events.  See TCG PC Client Platform Firmware Profile Specification.

Note: in clearing the attestation log, it is automatically recreated using current measurements.



    34. Get Attestation Data

Get the raw data used to generate measurements reported in the attestation log.  Not all measurements will have raw data available, as this is mostly intended for measurements generated over small amounts of data or text.  Requests for entries that don’t provide the measured data will generate a normal response with an empty payload.  Requests for invalid entries will generate an error response.

While this command is intended to support small pieces of that data that should fit into a single MCTP message, an offset parameter is included in the request to support scenarios where the required data is too large.

PFM payload includes PFM signature and monotonic forward only Id.  PFM signature is verified upon receipt of all PFM payloads.   PFMs are activated upon the activation command.   Note if a system is rebooted after receiving a PFM, the PFM is atomically activated.   To activate before reboot, issue the Activate PFM command.



    40. Activate Platform Firmware Manifest

Upon valid PFM update, the update command seals the PFM committal method.  If committing immediately, flash reads and writes should be suspended when this command is issued. The RoT will master the SPI bus and verify the newly updated PFM.  This command can only follow a valid PFM update.

    56. Reset Configuration

Resets configuration parameters back to the default state.  Depending on the request parameters, different amounts of types of configuration can be erased, and each type of configuration may require different levels of authorization to complete.

If authorization is required for the operation to complete, the response will contain a device-specific, one-time use, authorization token that must be signed with the PFM key to unlock the operation.  The authorization token has the following behavior:



1. A request for the same operation without providing the signed authorization token will generate a new token that invalidates any old token.  This is true even if the old token has not been used yet.
2. After an authorization token has been used to unlock an operation, it can never be used again.  A new token must be requested.  This is true even if the requested operation was not able to complete successfully.
3. A failure to authorize the request when providing a signed token does not invalidate the current authorization token in the device.

If authorization is not required, or the request is sent with a signed token, a standard error response will be returned indicating the status.

    63. Platform Measurement Register

Returns the Cerberus Platform Measurement Register (PMR), which is a digest of the Cerberus Firmware, PFM, CFM and PCD.   This information contained in PMR0 is Cerberus firmware.  PMR1-2 are reserved for PFM/CFM/PCD and other configuration. PMR3-4 are reserved for external usages.

Attestation requires that at least PMR0 be maintained, since that is the measurement reported in the challenge response message.  At a minimum, PMR0 should contain any security configuration of the device and all firmware components.  This includes any firmware actively running as well as firmware that was run to boot the device.  For ease of attestation, PMR0 is intended to only contain static information.  If variable data will also be measured, these measurements should be exposed through PMR1-2.

7. Platform Active RoT (PA-RoT)

The PA-RoT is responsible for challenging the AC-RoT’s and collecting their firmware measurements.  The PA-RoT retains a private manifest of active components that includes addresses, buses, firmware versions, digests and firmware topologies.

The manifest informs the PA-RoT on all the Active Components in the system.  It provides their I2C addresses, and information on how to verify their measurements against a known or expected state.  Polices configured in the Platform RoT determine what action it should take should the measurements fail verification. 

In the Cerberus designed motherboard, the PA-RoT orchestrates power-on.   Only Active Components listed in the challenge manifest, that pass verification will be released from power-on reset.



    68. Platform Firmware Manifest (PFM) and Component Firmware Manifest

The PA-RoT contains a Platform Firmware Manifest (PFM) that describes the firmware permitted on the Platform.  The Component Firmware Manifest (CFM) describes the firmware permitted for components in the Platform.   The Platform Configuration Data (PCD), specific to each SKU describes the number of Component types in the platform and their respective locations.  

Note: The PFM and CFM are different from the boot key manifest described in the Processor Secure Boot Requirements specification.  The PFM and CFM describe firmware permitted to run in the system across Platform and Active Components.  The CFM is a complement to the PFM, generated by the PA-RoT for the measurement comparison of components in the system.  This complement is as the Reported Firmware Manifest (RFM), which is like the TCG log.  The PFM and RFM are stored encrypted in the PA-RoT.  The symmetric encryption key for the PA-RoT is hardware generated and unique to each microcontroller.  The symmetric key in the PA-Rot is not exportable or firmware readable; and only accessible to the crypto engine for encryption/decryption.  The AES Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) encryption a unique auditable tag to any changes to the manifest at both an application level and persistent storage level.

The following table lists the attributes stored in the PFM for each Active component:

The PA-RoT actively takes measurements of flash from platform firmware, the PFM provides metadata that instructs the RoT on measurement and signature verification.  The PA-RoT stores the measurements in the RFM.   The PA-Rot then challenges the AC-RoTs for their measurements using the Platform Configuration Data.  it compares measurements from the AC-RoT’s to the CFM, while recording measurements in the RFM.  

The measurements of the Platform firmware and Component firmware are compared to the PFM and CFM.  Should a mismatch occur, the PA-RoT would raise an event log and invoke the policy action defined for the Platform and/or Component.   A variety of actions can be automated for a PFM/CFM challenge failure.  Actions are defined in the CFM and PCD files.   

Note:  The PA-RoT and AC-RoT enforce secure boot and only permit the download of digitally signed and unrevoked firmware.   A PFM or CFM mismatch can only occur when firmware integrity is brought into question.  



    69. RoT External Communication interface

The PA-RoT connects to the platform through, either SPI, QSPI depending on the motherboard.  Although the PA-RoT physically connects to the SPI bus, the microprocessor appears transparent to the host as it presents only a flash interface.  The management interface into the PA-RoT and AC-RoTs is an  I2C bus channeled through the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).  The BMC can reach all AC-RoTs in the platform.  The BMC bridges the PA-RoT to the Rack Manager, which in-turn bridges the rack to the Datacenter management network.   The interface into the PA-RoT is as follows:


    Figure 12 External Communication Interface


    

<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")


The Datacenter Management (DCM) software can communicate with the PA-RoT Out-Of-Band (OOB) through the Rack Manager.  The Rack Manager allows tunneling through to the Baseboard Management Controller, which connects to the PA-RoT over I2C.  This channel is assumed insecure, which is why all communicates are authenticated and encrypted.   The Datacenter Management Software can collect the RFM measurements and other challenge data over this secure channel.   Secure updates are also possible over this channel.

   



    70. Host Interface

The host can communicate with the PA-RoT and AC-RoTs through the BMC host interface.  Similar to the OOB path, the BMC bridges the host-side LPC/eSPI interface to the I2C interface on the RoT.   The host through BMC is an unsecure channel, and therefore requires authentication and confidentiality.



    71. Out Of Band (OOB) Interface

The OOB interface is essential for reporting potential firmware compromises during power-on.  Should firmware corruption occur during power-on, the OOB channel can communicate with the DCM software while the CPU is held in reset.  If the recovery policy determines the system should remain powered off, it’s still possible for the DCM software to interrogate the PA-RoT for detailed status and make a determination on the remediation. 

The OOB communication to Cerberus requires TLS and Certificate Authentication.



8. Legacy Interface

The legacy interface is defined for backward combability with devices that do not support MCTP.   These devices must provide a register set with specific offsets for Device Capabilities, Receiving Alias Certificate, accepting a Nonce, and providing an offset for Signed Firmware Measurements.  The payload structures will closely match that of the MCTP protocol version.  Legacy interfaces to no support session based authentication but permit signed measurements.



    72. Protocol Format

The legacy protocol leverages the SMBus Write/Read Word and Block commands.   The interface is register based using similar read and write subroutines of I2C devices.   The data transmit and receive requirements are 32 bytes or greater.   Large payloads can be truncated and retrieved recursively spanning multiple block read or write commands.  

The block read SMBUS command is specified in the SMBUS specification.   Slave address write and command code bytes are transmitted by the master, then a repeated start and finally a slave address read.   The master keeps clocking as the slaves responds with the selected data.    The command code byte can be considered register space.  



    73. PEC Handling

An SMBus legacy protocol implementation may leverage the 8bit SMBus Packet Error Check (PEC) for transactional data integrity.  The PEC is calculated by both the transmitter and receiver of each packet using the 8-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC-8) of both read or write bus transaction.    The PEC accumulates all bytes sent or received after the start condition.

An Active RoT that receives an invalid PEC can optionally NACK the byte that carried the incorrect PEC value or drop the data for the transaction and any further transactions (read or write) until the next valid read or write Start transaction is received.



    74. Message Splitting

The protocol supports Write Block and Read Block commands.  Standard SMBus transactions are limited to 32 bytes of data.  It is expected that some Active Component RoTs with intrinsic Cerberus capabilities may have limited I2C message buffer designed around the SMBus protocol that limit them to 32 bytes.   To overcome hardware limitations in message lengths, the Capabilities register includes a buffer size for determining the maximum packet size for messages.   This allows the Platform’s Active RoT to send messages larger than 32 bytes.   If the Active Component RoT only permits 32 bytes of data, the Platform’s Active RoT can segment the Read or Write Blocks into multiple packets totaling the entire message.  Each segment includes decrementing packet number that sequentially identifies the part of the overall message.   To stay within the protocol length each message segment must be no longer than 255 bytes.



    75. Payload Format

The payload portions of the SMBus Write and Read blocks will encapsulate the protocol defined in this specification.  The SMBus START and STOP framing and ACK/NACK bit conditions are omitted from this portion of the specification for simplification.  To review the specifics of START and STOP packet framing and ACK/NACK conditions refer to the SMBus specification.  

The data blocks of the Write and Read commands will encapsulate the message payload.   The encapsulated payload includes a uint16 register offset and data section.



    76. Register Format

The SMBUS command byte indexes the register, while additional writes offsets index inside the register space.   The offset and respective response is encapsulated into the data portions of I2C Write and Read Block commands.   The PA-RoT is always the I2C master, therefore Write and Read commands are described from the perspective of the I2C master.

Certain registers may contain partial or temporary data while the register is being written across multiple commands.    The completion or sealing of register writes can be performed by writing the seal register to the zero offset.

The following diagram depicts register read access flow for a large register space:

The SMBUS read command reads the response.   For register payload description see response: Table 24 GET DIGEST Response

The PA-Rot will use the digest to determine if it has the certificate already cached.   Unlike MCTP, only the Alias and Device Id cert is supported.   Therefore, it must be CA signed by a mutually trusted CA, as the CA Public Cert is not present



        6. Certificate

The SMBUS write command writes the offset into the register space.  For register payload description see response:  Table 26 GET CERTIFICATE Response


#### Unlike MCTP, only the Alias and Device Id cert is supported.   Therefore, it must be CA signed by mutually trusted CA, as the CA Public Cert is not present in the reduced challenge

The SMBUS write command writes a nonce for measurement freshness.
