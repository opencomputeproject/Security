# Objective

A summary of the problem this proposal intends to solve, along with background.

# Proposal

A technical description of how this proposal achieves the goals outlined above.
For example, this may include the introduction of new concepts, protocol
messages, and so on.

This section should explain the proposal in detail, but should not describe how
to achieve it in code or in standardsese; that is a task for the sections that
follow.

# Specification Changelist

A list of proposed changes to the specification(s) relevant to this proposal.
This should not be an actual diff of the specs; merely a description of the changes
to be made once the RFC is adopted.

If this RFC would introduce an entirely new spec document, describing the broad
strokes of what that document would contain is sufficient.

# Implementation Guidance

This section is optional.

For proposals which introduce significant complexity w.r.t. implementation of
the protocol, this section can give a brief description of how the proposal
might be implemented.

# Alternatives Considered

This section is optional.

Proposals may choose to include alternative approaches to solving their stated
problem, and why those were rejected in favor of the main one.

# Future Work

This section is optional.

Proposals may describe future RFCs that solve related, but out-of-scope
problems.
